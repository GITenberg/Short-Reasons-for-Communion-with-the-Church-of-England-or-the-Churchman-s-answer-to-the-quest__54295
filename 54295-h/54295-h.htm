<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>SHORT
REASONS FOR COMMUNION WITH THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND, &amp;c.</h2>
<h3>REASON I.</h3>
<p><i>I maintain communion with the Church of England</i>,
<i>not</i> <span class="GutSmall">MERELY</span> <i>because my
parents and forefathers were members of her community</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> connexion which my parents and
forefathers held with the Church of England I consider to be a
sufficient reason why I should continue in communion with her, if
there be nothing contrary to the law of God in such a
connexion.&nbsp; For the fifth commandment peremptorily requires
me to &ldquo;honour my father and mother;&rdquo; and, assuredly,
this duty implies reverence to their example, if that example be
not inconsistent with the rule of God&rsquo;s holy word.</p>
<p>But as a man&rsquo;s parents and forefathers may have been
members of a communion, a continuance in which would be
manifestly contrary to the word of God (as, for instance, if a
man were born of Popish or Socinian parents;) I therefore say,
that &ldquo;I maintain communion with the Church of England, not
<span class="GutSmall">MERELY</span> because my parents and
forefathers were members of her community.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>REASON II.</h3>
<p><i>I maintain communion with the Church of England</i>,
<i>not</i> <span class="GutSmall">MERELY</span><i> because she is
ancient and venerable</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Her</span> antiquity is a sufficient
reason to justify my continuance in her communion, if it can be
shown that nothing materially differing from the primitive and
apostolic Church, in doctrine or <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>discipline, has, in the long course of
her existence, been introduced into her constitution.&nbsp; For
the more ancient any Church can prove to be, the nearer is the
approach to the source of Divine authority and sanction.&nbsp;
Now the Church of England existed long before her corruption by
popery; and the labours and sufferings of her Martyrs in the
sixteenth century were employed, not in planting a new Church,
but in correcting gross abuses in one which had been long
established.&nbsp; They are therefore called
<i>Reformers</i>.&nbsp; The Church of England, as is highly
probable, was planted by St. Paul; and we know from credible
history, that there was a church in Britain during the apostolic
age, and that there were bishops who presided in it soon after
that period.</p>
<p>But as that which is ancient may have been corrupted,
antiquity alone would not fully justify my continuance in any
visible Church, though it strongly enforces the necessity of
earnestness and diligence in inquiring about the reality and
nature of the supposed corruption, before I venture to quit the
Church of which I have been made by baptism a member.</p>
<h3>REASON III.</h3>
<p><i>I maintain communion with the Church of England</i>,
<i>not</i> <span class="GutSmall">MERELY</span><i> because she is
established by law</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span>, like the two former reasons,
is a sufficient one to enforce my continuance in communion with
the Church of England, unless she be found, after <i>due</i>
inquiry, to be contrary, in her constitution or doctrines, to the
word of God.&nbsp; For I <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>am required to &ldquo;submit myself to
every ordinance of man for the Lord&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Nothing can justify my departure from a church so established,
but the well-known decision in cases where the law of God and the
law of man are in opposition to each other.&nbsp; In any such
case the duty is clear to &ldquo;obey God rather than
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such an opposition may exist between human laws and the law of
God; and therefore &ldquo;I maintain communion with the Church of
England, not <span class="GutSmall">MERELY</span> because she is
established by law.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>REASON IV.</h3>
<p><i>But I maintain communion with the Church of England</i>,
<i>because her government is episcopal</i>, <i>i.e. by
Bishops</i>; <i>this being the mode of Church government which
existed in the primitive Church</i>, <i>and was founded by the
Apostles of our Lord</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> stating reasons for conformity
which are to be comprised within a few pages, it is impossible to
enter at large into the proof of the fact here asserted, viz.
that the primitive church as founded by the Apostles of our Lord,
was episcopal; or, in other words, that the power of ordination
and government in the church was vested by the Apostles in
officers superior to the order of Presbyters, and who are now
called by the name of Bishops.&nbsp; I must therefore only state
a few circumstances, which are capable of being clearly proved,
without producing the evidence on which my belief of them is
built.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Episcopal government, as established in the Church of
England, has all the authority in its <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>favour which prescription or long
usage can give it.&nbsp; The most learned of its adversaries have
never been able to fix on any period in the Christian Church,
from the time of the Apostles to the Reformation, in which the
ordination of men to the ministry of the gospel was considered to
be vested in any other minister or ministers than a Bishop.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; All the instances of ordination, recorded in the New
Testament, are in favour of Episcopacy.&nbsp; For there is no
single instance of ordination, on record there, performed by
presbyters, or at least without the presence and co-operation of
some officer superior to presbyters.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; All the directions concerning ordination, given in
the New Testament, are addressed to persons superior to
presbyters.&nbsp; Such, confessedly, were Timothy and Titus; and
to them only are any such directions given.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; The Apostles, at their decease, left the government
of the several churches which they had planted, and the
ordination of their ministers, in the hands of fixed Bishops.</p>
<p>It may be granted that, during the life-time of the Apostles,
the title Bishops, was common to all presbyters, and that this
name was not confined to an officer superior to presbyters till
after their decease.&nbsp; For it is not the name but the office
about which I am inquiring.&mdash;It moreover appears that,
during the life of the Apostles, some churches had each its
settled Bishop, as the seven churches of Asia, who are addressed
in their several epistles through the medium of an individual;
(Rev. ii. 3.) and that of Crete, where Titus was left by St.
Paul. (Titus i. 2.)&nbsp; Other churches however had none as yet
settled among them, being <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>under the immediate government of the
Apostles, who frequently visited or sent to them, and either
themselves, or by other superior officers, ordained ministers for
them.</p>
<p>But immediately after the death of the Apostles there was, in
every church, an officer superior to presbyters, who was called
by way of distinction a Bishop.&nbsp; This we learn from express
testimonies in the remaining writings of men who lived in the
time of the Apostles; such as Clemens Romanus, mentioned in Phil.
iv. 3.&mdash;Ignatius, Bishop of Antioch, who suffered martyrdom
in the year 107; and Polycarp, Bishop of Smyrna, who was burned
in the year 167, aged one hundred years or more.&nbsp; These
excellent apostolic men have expressly spoken in their epistles
of Bishops, Priests, and Deacons, as the stated officers of the
Christian Churches, assigning to the former the prerogatives or
rights of government and ordination in their several
districts.&nbsp; Besides this, ancient historians of the church
have given lists of successive Bishops, that is, of individual
presidents, in several of the more important churches, reaching
up to the very time of the Apostles.</p>
<p>Now it is not to be supposed that, immediately after the death
of the Apostles, any innovation or change, so important and
invidious as that of episcopal government, would or could have
been introduced; or that, supposing it to be destitute of
apostolic sanction, its introduction should produce no
opposition.&nbsp; Much less is it to be supposed that such men as
Clemens, Ignatius, and Polycarp, the disciples and friends of the
Apostles, would have suffered such an innovation to be
introduced, and have mentioned it in the highest terms of
approbation.&nbsp; But the truth is, that they speak <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>of the three
orders of Bishops, Priests, and Deacons, in the Christian Church
as conformed to the three ranks of ministers in the Jewish
Church, the High Priests, the common Priests, and the Levites, <a
name="citation8"></a><a href="#footnote8"
class="citation">[8]</a>&mdash;as ordained by Christ himself, and
as existing even during His own ministry, He himself acting as
the great Bishop, His Apostles as His <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>Presbyters, and the seventy disciples
as His Deacons: and as at length established in the universal
Church by apostolic authority and usage.</p>
<p>On this ground then I justify my continuance in the Church of
England, viz. its conformity in this important branch of its
constitution to the primitive and apostolic church.&nbsp; But I
wish it to be understood that I assign my reasons for such a
continuance, not with a view to the conversion of those to my
sentiments who are not members of our church; but merely for the
purpose of showing that I do not act without reason, and of
confirming those who are members of our own church, but have not
had an opportunity of obtaining information on the subject under
consideration,&mdash;of confirming them in their attachment to
that church, which I consider to be &ldquo;built,&rdquo; in its
constitution as well as its doctrines, &ldquo;on the foundation
of the Apostles and Prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the
chief corner-stone.&rdquo;&nbsp; From <span
class="smcap">Him</span> all authority descends; for in <span
class="smcap">Him</span>, as &ldquo;the head of His body the
church,&rdquo; it is all vested by Divine appointment.&nbsp;
&ldquo;All power is given unto me in heaven and upon
earth.&mdash;Go ye <i>therefore</i> and teach (or make disciples
of) all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Ghost.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus He handed down the
authority He had received to His Apostles; they transmitted it to
their immediate successors; and so it has descended to the
Bishops or chief pastors of the church in our own day.&nbsp;
Without wishing to interfere with the right of private judgment
which belongs to every man, and for the exercise of which he is
accountable to God only; I own that I cannot see how the
Christian Church as a visible society, could have been continued
in <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>the
world without such a communication of Divine authority.</p>
<h3>REASON V.</h3>
<p><i>I maintain communion with the Church of England</i>,
<i>because her doctrines are fixed by articles of Religion</i>,
<i>which appear to me to be derived from and perfectly
conformable to the Scriptures of Truth</i>.</p>
<p>I <span class="GutSmall">AM</span> fully aware that some among
the ministers of the church to which I belong, may have entered
into her service without understanding or fully approving the
articles to which they subscribed their assent and consent, and
consequently may preach doctrines differing from those of the
church whose ministers they are.&nbsp; The possibility of the
supposed case appears from the painful necessity, under which a
late Bishop of London was laid, of depriving an unsound clergyman
of his office.&nbsp; But such ministers cannot do this without
exposing their own ignorance or hypocrisy; nor can their own
unbelief make the faith of the church of no effect.&nbsp; These
articles I consider to be the bulwark of orthodoxy or true
doctrine in our church,&mdash;the means of her preservation from
apostacy in the lowest state of spiritual life to which she has
been or may be reduced, and of providing for her recovery from
such a state whenever God is pleased to breathe upon her.&nbsp; A
declaration or subscription to the truth of the Bible would
afford no security, as all who bear the Christian name, however
heretical or unsound in opinion, pretend to derive their creed
from the <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>word of God.&nbsp; I conceive therefore that it is of
high importance to have the principal articles of the Christian
faith embodied in such a way, that no heretic can, without
manifest dishonesty, subscribe to them.&nbsp; If the incumbent or
minister of any parish be thus dishonest, having subscribed to
what he never cordially believed, and preaching doctrines
contrary to the articles he has subscribed, when his incumbency
or ministry in that parish ceases by death or any other cause,
the articles of the church remain in full force.&nbsp; But if no
such test existed, and if the election to church preferment were
vested in the people, a single incumbency might so corrupt the
opinions of the congregation as to perpetuate heresy from
generation to generation.</p>
<p>I continue therefore in the communion of the Church of
England, because she has fixed principles, and those principles
are, in my judgment, scriptural and &ldquo;according to
godliness.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>REASON VI.</h3>
<p><i>I maintain communion with the Church of England</i>,
<i>because her mode of worship is primitive and scriptural</i>,
<i>and in my judgment best calculated to promote general and
individual edification</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Wheatly has proved (referring us to the testimonies
of Josephus, Philo, Paul Fagius, &amp;c.) that the ancient Jews
did always worship God in public by precomposed forms.&nbsp; Dr.
Lightfoot not only affirms the same thing, but sets down both the
order and method of their hymns and supplications.&nbsp; Now it
appears from the general tenour of <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>the four Gospels, and particularly
from Luke iv. 16. that our Saviour habitually attended at the
service of the Temple, or of the Synagogue, on every Sabbath-day.
<a name="citation12a"></a><a href="#footnote12a"
class="citation">[12a]</a>&nbsp; He therefore, by this act, from
week to week, gave a public sanction to all the Jewish forms of
Divine worship.&nbsp; And had it been otherwise, the Scribes and
Pharisees, His implacable foes and persecutors, would not have
failed to load Him with their severest reproaches, as an open
enemy to all godliness.&nbsp; He lived and died a member of the
Jewish Church.&nbsp; He moreover gave a set form of prayer to His
Apostles, which has ever since been used in the Christian
Church.&nbsp; And it is evident from many passages in the book of
their acts, that they also, in conformity to His Divine example,
did attend on the service both of the Temple and Synagogue; and
it is expressly said, (Acts xvii. 2.) that it was &lsquo;<i>the
manner</i>&rsquo; of Paul so to do.&nbsp; The apostolic practice
is therefore another sanction to the same religious
institution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Wheatly has also shown, by sundry appeals to
ancient Christian writers, that the three first centuries joined
in the use of precomposed set forms of prayer, besides the
Lord&rsquo;s prayer and Psalms; and that these were styled by so
early a writer as Justin Martyr, who died in the year of our Lord
163, &lsquo;<i>Common Prayers</i>;&rsquo; by Origen,
&lsquo;<i>Constituted Prayers</i>;&rsquo; and by Cyprian,
&lsquo;<i>Solemn Prayers</i>.&rsquo;&mdash;From hence the
inference is fairly drawn, that a liturgy composed for public
use, is warranted by the practice of our Saviour, of His
Apostles, and of the primitive Christians.&rdquo; <a
name="citation12b"></a><a href="#footnote12b"
class="citation">[12b]</a></p>
<h3><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>REASON
VII.</h3>
<p><i>I maintain communion with the Church of England</i>,
<i>because her Liturgy is scriptural in its doctrine</i>,
<i>plain in its style</i>, <i>comprehensive in its addresses to
the throne of mercy</i>, <i>and therefore adapted to general
use</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> confirmation of this reason, I
shall content myself with the declaration of one, whose testimony
may have the more weight in consequence of his being unconnected
with the Church whose liturgy he has extolled, the eloquent and
candid Robert Hall.&nbsp; At the Leicester Bible Society he spoke
thus of our Liturgy.&nbsp; &ldquo;I believe that the evangelical
purity of its sentiments, the chastised fervour of its devotion,
and the majestic simplicity of its language, have placed it in
the very first rank of uninspired compositions.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>REASON VIII.</h3>
<p><i>I maintain communion with the Church of England</i>,
<i>because a separation from her</i>, <i>without a sufficient
reason</i>, <i>would</i>, <i>in my opinion</i>, <i>be a great
sin</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">There</span> is, undeniably, such a
sin as <i>schism</i>, against which we are precautioned in the
New Testament, as being one proof of carnality in a religious
professor, (1 Cor. iii. 3.) and as being diametrically opposite
to the duty of &lsquo;endeavouring to keep the unity of the
Spirit in the bond of peace&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By <i>schism</i> we are to understand a
<i>causeless</i> secession from our Church, into the communion of
which we have been solemnly admitted by baptism.&nbsp; <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>And that such
a secession would be causeless on our part, is evident from this
simple consideration, that our Church neither proposes to our
faith any doctrine which is not evidently contained in the
Scripture; nor obtrudes on us any practice which the Scriptures
forbids, nor restrains us from the observation of any rule which
the Scripture enjoins.&rdquo; <a name="citation14"></a><a
href="#footnote14" class="citation">[14]</a></p>
<p>It is not, in my humble opinion, a sufficient reason for a
separation from the general Church to which I belong, that the
gospel is not preached from the pulpit of the particular place in
which I live.&nbsp; To admit for argument sake, the worst case
that can occur, viz. that a Socinian clergyman had, through his
own hypocrisy in subscription, got possession of the pulpit of my
parish; my removal from that parish to another, if I could find
no other way of remedying the calamity, would be a less evil than
the act of separation, and the encouragement of a spirit of
division in the Church of Christ.&nbsp; The word of God prohibits
my making such a division; but it no where forbids me to make any
sacrifice of temporal emolument or accommodation for the benefit
of my own soul, or the souls of my family.</p>
<h3>REASON IX.</h3>
<p><i>I maintain communion with the Church of England</i>,
<i>because I have discovered no sufficient reason for a
separation from her</i>.</p>
<p>I <span class="GutSmall">WISH</span> it to be distinctly
understood that I judge no man, however his views of this subject
may differ from my own.&nbsp; Every man must act <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>according to
the guidance of his own conscience, after having seriously and
diligently used all the means within his reach, by reading and
prayer, to obtain information and direction.&nbsp; It is not to
those who conscientiously dissent from our communion that I
address my reasons; but to those of my own Church.&nbsp; And if
any of these should be confirmed in their attachment to her by
reading my short statement of the grounds on which my own conduct
is built, I shall have attained the only end I have had in view,
and rejoice in my success.</p>
<h3>CONCLUSION.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Let</span> not my brother churchman,
however, satisfy himself with being a member of the visible
Church; but let him examine himself whether he be a living branch
in the true vine, united to Christ by faith, and bringing forth
the fruits of righteousness by virtue of union with Him.&nbsp;
Let him inquire whether he have ever experienced conversion to
God,&mdash;whether his heart have been humbled, spiritualized,
and comforted by those doctrines which he professes to believe as
derived from Scripture, and by that worship in which he professes
to join as being primitive and &ldquo;according to
godliness.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let him remember the solemn words of Him,
who is the Founder, Head, and Judge of the Christian
Church.&nbsp; At the close of His awful parable of the ten
virgins, He represents the foolish virgins, who had lamps without
oil, as coming to the door of the guest-chamber, and saying

answers, &ldquo;Verily, I say unto you, I know you

guest at the marriage feast in the gospel who had not on the
wedding garment. (Matt. xxii. 1, &amp;c.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am therefore to consider that all are not Israel that
are of Israel; all were not Jews that were circumcised; all are
not Christians that have been brought by baptism into the Church;
for many are called but few are chosen.&nbsp; Under the present
state of things, bad and good are together at the marriage feast
of the gospel; and many of those that are now <i>called</i> to be
among the rest will not be <i>chosen</i> at the last as fit for
the kingdom of God.&nbsp; I am therefore not to depend upon any
privileges I have at present, unless I use them right; and must
give all diligence to <i>make my calling and election
sure</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation16"></a><a href="#footnote16"

<p><a name="footnote8"></a><a href="#citation8"
class="footnote">[8]</a>&nbsp; The government of every synagogue
seems to have borne some resemblance of the general
ecclesiastical establishment in the Jewish Church.&nbsp; For
there were fixed ministers to take care of the religious duties
to be performed therein; and these were by imposition of hands
solemnly admitted to their office.&nbsp; He who presided is
called in the New Testament Archysynagogus, or the ruler of the
Synagogue.&nbsp; This word is sometimes used in a larger sense,
for any one of the officers who had power in the affairs of the
synagogue.&nbsp; Thus, (Acts xiii. 15.) we read of the rulers of
one synagogue, as we also read (Luke iii. 2.) that Annas and
Caiaphas were contemporary High Priests, though we know that in a
strict sense there could be but one who bore that office.&nbsp;
But generally and properly the word Archysynagogus describes the
president, or chief of the officers of the synagogue; as Luke
xiii. 14. and Acts xviii. 8, 17.</p>
<p>Next to the Archysynagogus were the Elders or presbyters of
the Synagogue.&nbsp; The person whose office it was to offer up
public prayer to God for the whole congregation, was probably one
of these.&nbsp; He was called <i>Sheliac Zibbor</i>, that is, the
Angel of the Church, because as their messenger, he spoke to God
for them.&nbsp; Hence the pastors of the seven churches of Asia,
in the book of the Revelation, are called by a name borrowed from
the Synagogue, &ldquo;Angels of the Churches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under these were inferior officers in every Synagogue, called
in Hebrew <i>Chezanim</i>, who were also fixed ministers, and
under the rulers of the Synagogue, had the charge and oversight
of all things in it.&nbsp; The deacon is mentioned in Luke iv.
20.</p>
<p>In every instance, so far as I have observed, our Lord adopted
the institutions of the Jewish Church, unless they were
inapplicable to His new dispensation.&nbsp; &ldquo;To the end we
may understand apostolical tradition to have been taken from the
Old Testament; that which Aaron, and his sons, and the Levites
were in the Temple, Bishops, Presbyters, and Deacons in the
Church may lawfully challenge to themselves.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>St.
Hierom</i>, <i>Ep.</i> 85.</p>

law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks

  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
